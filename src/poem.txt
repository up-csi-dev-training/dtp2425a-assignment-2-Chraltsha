    The Sunlit Fountain

└────────── •◐◑• ──────────┘

I sit high above from the sun
Below is a freezing monsoon
The sky is lacquered in jet black
With stars that will take you aback

I see a sparkling beauty below
I turned my attention, wanting to know 
It was a fountain in the glooming night
Its shimmering water shining so bright

It immediately caught my eye
Its water bluer than the sky
A being ever so perfect
She acquired all of my respect

I started to contemplate my options
Can I escape the land that I am on?
For a small chance to be right by her side
Thinking our existence can coincide

I tried to escape from the sun
Crossing the void like a buffoon
It was a place way too distant
But I swore to be persistent

It seems to be the sole thing in my gaze
The fountain that had set my heart ablaze
I fantasize about touching the Earth
The thought of it feeling like a rebirth

As I struggle through the dark void
I grow increasingly annoyed
The Earth going further away
My mind going into dismay

The endeavor proved too much to handle 
My heart becoming a waning candle
The dark vacuum of space sucks my lungs dry
I float along, just hoping not to die

The fountain lives on without knowing of my yearning existence
I dream of a new world where there isn't a distance between us
